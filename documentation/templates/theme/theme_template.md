"As a website owner, I want to measure user behavior using Google Analytics so that I can optimize the website and improve the user experience. By integrating Google Analytics into the website and setting up custom event tracking, we can gain insights into user behavior and make data-driven decisions about how to improve the website. This will enable us to create a more engaging and user-friendly website that meets the needs of our users. By following the lean agile project management and DevOps principles, we can rapidly iterate and deploy changes based on user feedback, delivering a product that meets the evolving needs of our users and setting us up for long-term success."
