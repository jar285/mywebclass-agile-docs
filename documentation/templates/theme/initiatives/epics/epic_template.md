# Epic 1: "Curriculum Development"

## Description: 
The Curriculum Development Epic involves creating a comprehensive curriculum for teaching software engineering and advanced technologies in education.

Goals: 
1. Develop a curriculum that covers a range of topics in software developer such as Git and advanced technologies.
2. Create course materials and resources that are engaging and accessible for educators and students.
3. Ensure that the curriculum aligns with industry standards and current best practices in software development.

User Stories:
1. As an educator, I want to have access to a range of course materials and resources that cover various topics in software development and advanced technologies.
2. As a student, I want to have access to engaging and interactive course materials that help me learn and understand complex concepts.
3. As a software developer, I want to be able to provide feedback on the curriculum and suggest updates or improvements as needed.

Dependencies: 
1. Availability of subject matter experts and industry professionals to provide input and guidance on curriculum development.
2. Availability of technology and resources to create and deliver course materials.
3. Availability of funding to support the development and implementation of the curriculum.

Risks: 
1. Difficulty in creating a curriculum that is relevant and up-to-date with rapidly evolving technology.
2. Lack of engagement or interest from educators and students.
3. Insufficient funding or resources to support the development and implementation of the curriculum.

Mitigation Strategies: 
1. Regularly review and update the curriculum to ensure that it stays current and relevant.
2. Solicit feedback and input from educators and students to ensure that the curriculum meets their needs and preferences.
3. Seek out additional funding or resources through partnerships, grants, or other means.

Estimated Effort:
1. Approximately 4-5 weeks, depending on the scope of the curriculum and availability of resources.

Business Value:
1. The Curriculum Development Epic will deliver significant business value by providing educators and students with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive and relevant in the rapidly evolving field of software engineering.

Priority:
1. The Curriculum Development Epic is a critical component of the mywebclass.org initiative, as it is the foundation for the education and training that the website will provide.
